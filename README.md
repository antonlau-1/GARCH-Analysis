This repository stores the MATLAB script I used to perform GARCH - EGARCH analysis on historic data of S&P 500. I also performed Ljung Box Test and AIC / BIC analysis 
to decide which model is better suited for the goal of exploring the volatility of stalk vs global events.

This is a passion project of mine to 
- apply theory to real life problems
- further my understanding of the global economic life cycle
